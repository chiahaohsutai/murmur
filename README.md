# Murmur

Murmur is a speech-to-text web application built with `Actix-Web`, `HTMX`, `Askama`, and `Whisper-rs`.
It provides web-based audio transcription powered by OpenAI’s Whisper model.

This project applies the principles from [Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/), with a focus on building fully server-driven web applications using Rust.

I’m especially interested in exploring low-JS development patterns — moving away from single-page applications (SPAs) — while taking advantage of Rust’s performance, safety, and modern web tooling.
