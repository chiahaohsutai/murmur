# Murmur

**Murmur** is a speech-to-text web application built with **Actix-Web**, **Askama**, and **Whisper-rs**.  
It provides web-based audio transcription powered by OpenAI’s Whisper model.

This project is inspired by the ideas in [*Hypermedia Systems*](https://hypermedia.systems/), with a focus on building fully server-driven web applications.

I'm particularly interested in **low-JS development patterns** — moving away from single-page applications (SPAs) — and embracing approaches that rely on minimal, lightweight JavaScript.  

With Murmur, I aimed to explore how modern web applications can be built efficiently using Rust's performance, safety, and robust web ecosystem, without depending on heavy frontend frameworks.
